# HandsDrawingFewerButtons
Therapy Tool to draw on an image of hands and select stretches for specific cutaneous hand injuries.

Instructions for using Cutaneokinematic Hand App

The hand app is intended for use with smaller, more specific skin injuries that do not include the entire hand. Any circumferential injuries or injuries that affect the entire dorsal or volar surfaces of a hand will be best recorded by the Cutaneokinematic Body App.

This app is separated into two user functions: Drawing and Selection. 
At any time the user can toggle between the functions using the mode toggle labeled "Switch to...".
When in drawing mode, the button will read "Switch to Selection Mode". Clicking the button will enter the app function to select cutaneokinematic regions. 
When in selection mode, the button will read "Switch to Draw Mode". Clicking the button will enter the app function to draw shapes on the hand image.
At any time, the user may enter alphanumeric characters in the sections above the app image and buttons.
Upon opening, the program is set to the drawing function and will default to black dots representing "Second Degree Superficial" burns.

When in Draw Mode, the user can select desired labeled patterns from the legend buttons.
The legend buttons are divided into three sections: Skin Injuries, Graft Prep/Support, and Grafts.
After selecting the desired pattern, the clinician then draws over the image holding down the left mouse button on laptops and desktops. On mobile devices, drawing occurs with single finger movements.
Continue drawing as many shapes as needed until a different pattern is required.
If a different pattern is needed for a different region of the hands, the clinician must click the button of the desired pattern before drawing.
If the clinician desires to undo the last drawn shape, they must click the button directly underneath the image labeled "Undo Last Shape".
The "Undo Last Shape" button can be clicked as many times as needed and will eliminate shapes in reverse order of their creation.
If the clinician desires to undo all shapes to start over, they must click the button directly underneath the image labeled "Clear Drawing".

When in Selection Mode, the user can click on Hand Cutaneokinematic regions affected by injuries. 
Each selected region will turn red and return information at the bottom of the screen under three labeled sections: Skin Affected, Stretches to Perform, and Potential Functional Implications. 
Clicking on a region a second time, will deselect that region and remove data output for that section at the bottom of the screen. 
At the bottom of the image, the program will display the list of cutaneokinematic selections followed by a list of prescribed stretches for full-thickness and deep partial-thickness injuries. 
The last list is possible functional implications from injuries to these different skin regions. 
The Functional Implications list is not exhaustive but rather general insight by the database authors based on locations of injuries. 
The "Clear Selections" button will clear all selection of hand regions and corresponding information so the clinician can start over.

Exporting the image and entire app screen requires clicking the "Save as PDF" button located directly above the hands image. Exporting as a PDF can be done at any point in the app use and can be done multiple times while the app is open. This app does not save any information. All information, including alphanumeric patient identifying information, is deleted upon closing the app. 

Special instructions for mobile use.
This app can be used on all mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets.
When used on a mobile device, the user can pinch-in or out with two fingers for zooming in and out.
Scrolling up and down can be done with one finger.
Pinching in and out and scrolling directly over the image can only occur during the Selection program mode.
When in the drawing mode, attempting to pinch over the image will result in drawn shapes over the image.
When zooming out is desired during the Drawing mode, the user needs to double-tap the floating "Reset" button or pinch over a non-image section of the screen.Pinching in and out can also occur directly over the alphanumeric input section above the image.
